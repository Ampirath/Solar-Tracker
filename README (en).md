# Solar-Tracker

A PROJECT FROM HIGH SCHOOL OF KISSAMOS

Solar energy is a 'green' energy source mainly gathered with the use of solar panels. However, we can only make the most out of solar energy when the sunlights fall perpenicularly on the panel. Given that, we looked for a way to create a 'smart' solar panel that always follows the sunlight. One way of doing that is by using LDR Sensors witch give the required information to an arduino. That controls the servos and 'tells' them to turn to the wanted angle.

Materials used :

1.arduino uno 
2. 4 ldr 
3. 2 servo (link: https://grobotronics.com/servo-small-5kg.cm-metal-gears-with-analog-feedback-feetech-fs9225m.html                                       https://grobotronics.com/analog-feedback-micro-servo-plastic-gear.html ) 
4.wires 
5.breadboard (link: https://grobotronics.com/adafruit-perma-proto-quarter-sized-breadboard-pcb-single.html ) 
6. Plastic 3D printed pieces (STL files are included as STL-files )

FINAL DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM

Our age is defined by the great energy recources it requires. Therefore, a solar panel with the most possible effieciency is greatly demanded. This project gives even more than that, as this solar tracker is also a solar path finer. This means that it collects data of the angles that the sun deleted during the day and so the user knows exactly the path that the sun follows and so wich is the best time and place for the solar tracker to be used. 
For this project we used 4 ldr sendors -which collect data about the angle at wich there is more sunlight - 2 feedback servo that turn the device at the right angle and also collect the data to find the sun's path. Of cource the arduino is 'brain' of Solar Tracker. The 3D pieces make the divive easy to make and give it the required stability. 

Our team is composed of three high school students :
Athina Athanasaki, Stela Ampouhani, Spyros Irinakis
