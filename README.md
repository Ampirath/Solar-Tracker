# Solar-Tracker
A solar panel controled by an arduino, programmed to always follow the light in order for the sunrays to fall perpendicularly on the solar panel resulting in its best possible efficiency. You also have the capability of viewing the angle deleted by the solar panel and and therefore find the sun's path in the area where the solar tracker was used.
